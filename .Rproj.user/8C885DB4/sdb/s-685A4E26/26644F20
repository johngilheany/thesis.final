The iShares data also had many errors that needed to be manually fixed. \n\\hfill\\break\n### Barra Optimizer\nThe Barra Optimizer is very complex, and this thesis did not take it into account when trying to predict index membership. Had it done so, the model could have been more accruate at predicting index rebalancing. \n",
