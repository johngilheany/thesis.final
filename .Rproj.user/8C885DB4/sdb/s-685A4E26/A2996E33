For EUSA, the 5 largest holdings were AAPL, XOM, MSFT, GE, and JNJ. Their change in weights are shown below. \n\n```{r, echo = FALSE}\ndata(usa)\nusa_weight3 <- aggregate(weight ~ ticker, data=usa, FUN=sum)\nminvol_weight3 <- aggregate(weight ~ ticker, data=minvol, FUN=sum)\n\nusa_sub1 <- filter(usa, ticker == \"AAPL\" | ticker == \"XOM\" | ticker == \"MSFT\" | ticker == \"GE\" | ticker == \"JNJ\")\nusa_sub1 <- select(usa_sub1, date, ticker, weight)\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot() + \n\tgeom_line(data = filter(usa_sub1, ticker == \"AAPL\"), aes(x = date, y = weight, color = \"AAPL\")) +\n\tgeom_line(data = filter(usa_sub1, ticker == \"XOM\"), aes(x = date, y = weight, color = \"XOM\"))  +\n\tgeom_line(data = filter(usa_sub1, ticker == \"MSFT\"), aes(x = date, y = weight, color = \"MSFT\"))  +\n\tgeom_line(data = filter(usa_sub1, ticker == \"GE\"), aes(x = date, y = weight, color = \"GE\"))  +\n\tgeom_line(data = filter(usa_sub1, ticker == \"JNJ\"), aes(x = date, y = weight, color = \"JNJ\"))  +\n\txlab('date') + ylab('weight') + ggtitle('Change in Weights of Top 5 EUSA Holdings')\n```\n\nShown above, for EUSA, are some very interesting findings. The weights of the 5 companies are all very high, then suddenly all spike. Verifying this in the data, showed that for all 5 companies, holdings dropped significantly between 2015-07-31 and 2015-08-31. The reason for this is not entirely clear, but the general ETF started performing poorly around this time too. In July of 2015 the price per share was 45.20, then it dropped to 42.60 the following month, and dropped again to 40.50 in August 2015. Perhaps these large companies were doing poorly, and MSCI decided to try underweighting them. \n\nFor USMV, the 5 largest holdings were VZ, T, ADP, JNJ, and MCD. Their change in weights are shown below. As we can see below, with the exception of Verizon, the holdings generally remain between 1 and 1.6 percent of the overall portfolio.\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE}\nminvol_sub1 <- filter(minvol, ticker == \"VZ\" | ticker == \"T\" | ticker == \"ADP\" | ticker == \"JNJ\" | ticker == \"MCD\")\nminvol_sub1 <- select(minvol_sub1, date, ticker, weight)\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot() + \n\tgeom_line(data = filter(minvol_sub1, ticker == \"VZ\"), aes(x = date, y = weight, color = \"VZ\")) +\n\tgeom_line(data = filter(minvol_sub1, ticker == \"T\"), aes(x = date, y = weight, color = \"T\"))  +\n\tgeom_line(data = filter(minvol_sub1, ticker == \"ADP\"), aes(x = date, y = weight, color = \"ADP\"))  +\n\tgeom_line(data = filter(minvol_sub1, ticker == \"JNJ\"), aes(x = date, y = weight, color = \"JNJ\"))  +\n\tgeom_line(data = filter(minvol_sub1, ticker == \"MCD\"), aes(x = date, y = weight, color = \"MCD\"))  +\n\txlab('date') + ylab('weight') + ggtitle('Change in Weights of Top 5 USMV Holdings')\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Tables\n\nIn addition to the tables that can be automatically generated from a data frame in **R** that you saw in [R Markdown Basics] using the `kable` function, you can also create tables using _pandoc_. (More information is available at <http://pandoc.org/README.html#tables>.)  This might be useful if you don't have values specifically stored in **R**, but you'd like to display them in table form.  Below is an example.  Pay careful attention to the alignment in the table and hyphens to create the rows and columns.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Factors                    Correlation between Parents & Child      Inherited\n------------------------- ----------------------------------------- --------------\n  Education                                -0.49                         Yes\n  \n  Socio-Economic Status                     0.28                        Slight   \n  \n  Income                                    0.08                          No\n  \n  Family Size                               0.18                        Slight\n  \n  Occupational Prestige                     0.21                        Slight\n------------------------- ----------------------------------------- --------------\nTable: (\\#tab:inher) Correlation of Inheritance Factors for Parents and Child \n\nWe can also create a link to the table by doing the following: Table \\@ref(tab:inher).  If you go back to [Loading and exploring data] and look at the `kable` table, we can create a reference to this max delays table too: Table \\@ref(tab:maxdelays). The addition of the `(\\#tab:inher)` option to the end of the table caption allows us to then make a reference to Table `\\@ref(tab:label)`. Note that this reference could appear anywhere throughout the document after the table has appeared.  \n\n<!-- We will next explore ways to create this label-ref link using figures. -->\n\n\\clearpage\n\n<!-- clearpage ends the page, and also dumps out all floats.\n  Floats are things like tables and figures. -->\n\n\n## Figures\n\nIf your thesis has a lot of figures, _R Markdown_ might behave better for you than that other word processor.  One perk is that it will automatically number the figures accordingly in each chapter.    You'll also be able to create a label for each figure, add a caption, and then reference the figure in a way similar to what we saw with tables earlier.  If you label your figures, you can move the figures around and _R Markdown_ will automatically adjust the numbering for you.  No need for you to remember!  So that you don't have to get too far into LaTeX to do this, a couple **R** functions have been created for you to assist.  You'll see their use below.\n\n<!--\nOne thing that may be annoying is the way _R Markdown_ handles \"floats\" like tables and figures (it's really \\LaTeX's fault). \\LaTeX\\ will try to find the best place to put your object based on the text around it and until you're really, truly done writing you should just leave it where it lies. There are some optional arguments specified in the options parameter of the `label` function.  If you need to shift your figure around, it might be good to look here on tweaking the options argument:  <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions>\n\nIf you need a graphic or tabular material to be part of the text, you can just put it inline. If you need it to appear in the list of figures or tables, it should be placed in a code chunk.\n-->\n\n\nIn the **R** chunk below, we will load in a picture stored as `reed.jpg` in our main directory.  We then give it the caption of \"Reed logo\", the label of \"reedlogo\", and specify that this is a figure.  Make note of the different **R** chunk options that are given in the R Markdown file (not shown in the knitted document).\n\n```{r reedlogo, fig.cap=\"Reed logo\"}\ninclude_graphics(path = \"figure/reed.jpg\")\n```\n\nHere is a reference to the Reed logo: Figure \\@ref(fig:reedlogo).  Note the use of the `fig:` code here.  By naming the **R** chunk that contains the figure, we can then reference that figure later as done in the first sentence here.  We can also specify the caption for the figure via the R chunk option `fig.cap`.\n\n\\clearpage \n\n<!-- starts a new page and stops trying to place floats such as tables and figures -->\n\nBelow we will investigate how to save the output of an **R** plot and label it in a way similar to that done above.  Recall the `flights` dataset from Chapter \\@ref(rmd-basics).  (Note that we've shown a different way to reference a section or chapter here.)  We will next explore a bar graph with the mean flight departure delays by airline from Portland for 2014.  Note also the use of the `scale` parameter which is discussed on the next page.\n\n```{r delaysboxplot, warnings=FALSE, messages=FALSE, fig.cap=\"Mean Delays by Airline\", fig.width=6}\nflights %>% group_by(carrier) %>%\n  summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = carrier, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"identity\", stat = \"identity\", fill = \"red\")\n```\n\nHere is a reference to this image: Figure \\@ref(fig:delaysboxplot).\n\nA table linking these carrier codes to airline names is available at <https://github.com/ismayc/pnwflights14/blob/master/data/airlines.csv>.\n\n\\clearpage\n\nNext, we will explore the use of the `out.extra` chunk option, which can be used to shrink or expand an image loaded from a file by specifying `\"scale= \"`. Here we use the mathematical graph stored in the \"subdivision.pdf\" file.\n\n```{r subd, results=\"asis\", echo=FALSE, fig.cap=\"Subdiv. graph\", out.extra=\"scale=0.75\"}\ninclude_graphics(\"figure/subdivision.pdf\")\n```\n\nHere is a reference to this image: Figure \\@ref(fig:subd).  Note that `echo=FALSE` is specified so that the **R** code is hidden in the document.\n\n**More Figure Stuff**\n\nLastly, we will explore how to rotate and enlarge figures using the `out.extra` chunk option.  (Currently this only works in the PDF version of the book.)\n\n```{r subd2, results=\"asis\", echo=FALSE, out.extra=\"angle=180, scale=1.1\", fig.cap=\"A Larger Figure, Flipped Upside Down\"}\ninclude_graphics(\"figure/subdivision.pdf\")\n```\n\nAs another example, here is a reference: Figure \\@ref(fig:subd2).  \n\n## Footnotes and Endnotes\n\nYou might want to footnote something. ^[footnote text] The footnote will be in a smaller font and placed appropriately. Endnotes work in much the same way. More information can be found about both on the CUS site or feel free to reach out to <data@reed.edu>.\n\n## Bibliographies\n\nOf course you will need to cite things, and you will probably accumulate an armful of sources. There are a variety of tools available for creating a bibliography database (stored with the .bib extension).  In addition to BibTeX suggested below, you may want to consider using the free and easy-to-use tool called Zotero.  The Reed librarians have created Zotero documentation at <http://libguides.reed.edu/citation/zotero>.  In addition, a tutorial is available from Middlebury College at <http://sites.middlebury.edu/zoteromiddlebury/>.\n\n_R Markdown_ uses _pandoc_ (<http://pandoc.org/>) to build its bibliographies.  One nice caveat of this is that you won't have to do a second compile to load in references as standard LaTeX requires. To cite references in your thesis (after creating your bibliography database), place the reference name inside square brackets and precede it by the \"at\" symbol.  For example, here's a reference to a book about worrying:  [@Molina1994].  This `Molina1994` entry appears in a file called `thesis.bib` in the `bib` folder.  This bibliography database file was created by a program called BibTeX.  You can call this file something else if you like (look at the YAML header in the main .Rmd file) and, by default, is to placed in the `bib` folder.  \n\nFor more information about BibTeX and bibliographies, see our CUS site (<http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/index.html>)^[@reedweb2007]. There are three pages on this topic:  _bibtex_ (which talks about using BibTeX, at <http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtex.html>), _bibtexstyles_ (about how to find and use the bibliography style that best suits your needs, at <http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtexstyles.html>) and _bibman_ (which covers how to make and maintain a bibliography by hand, without BibTeX, at <http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibman.html>). The last page will not be useful unless you have only a few sources.\n\nIf you look at the YAML header at the top of the main .Rmd file you can see that we can specify the style of the bibliography by referencing the appropriate csl file.  You can download a variety of different style files at <https://www.zotero.org/styles>.  Make sure to download the file into the csl folder.\n\n**Tips for Bibliographies**\n\n- Like with thesis formatting, the sooner you start compiling your bibliography for something as large as thesis, the better. Typing in source after source is mind-numbing enough; do you really want to do it for hours on end in late April? Think of it as procrastination.\n- The cite key (a citation's label) needs to be unique from the other entries.\n- When you have more than one author or editor, you need to separate each author's name by the word \"and\" e.g. `Author = {Noble, Sam and Youngberg, Jessica},`.\n- Bibliographies made using BibTeX (whether manually or using a manager) accept LaTeX markup, so you can italicize and add symbols as necessary.\n- To force capitalization in an article title or where all lowercase is generally used, bracket the capital letter in curly braces.\n- You can add a Reed Thesis citation^[@noble2002] option. The best way to do this is to use the phdthesis type of citation, and use the optional \"type\" field to enter \"Reed thesis\" or \"Undergraduate thesis.\" \n\n## Anything else?\n\nIf you'd like to see examples of other things in this template, please contact the Data @ Reed team (email <data@reed.edu>) with your suggestions. We love to see people using _R Markdown_ for their theses, and are happy to help.\n\n",
