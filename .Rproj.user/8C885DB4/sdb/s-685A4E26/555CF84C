David helped spark my interest in the field of quantitative finance while advising me, alongside Professor Parzen, for a statistics research and reading class. Much of the literature I read then served as the foundation for this thesis. David also supervised me directly while I interned at Hutchin Hill Capital during January break, regularly discussing my research with me. I am also very grateful to David for meeting with me throughout the semester to give suggestions and comments on my work. I cannot thank David enough for his time and guidance. Professor Parzen has also been extremely helpful throughout the writing process, offering countless revisions and edit suggestions. I am grateful for Professor Parzenâ€™s statistical perspective, and helping throughout the data collection and analysis portions. I would also like to thank Professor Mark Glickman for reviewing my logistic regression model and offering suggestions for improvement, and to my friends and family for proofreading my thesis.   \nbibliography: bib/thesis.bib\n# Download your specific bibliography database file and refer to it in the line above.\ncsl: csl/apa.csl\n# Download your specific csl file and refer to it in the line above.\nlot: true\nlof: true\n# space_between_paragraphs: true\n# Delete the # at the beginning of the previous line if you'd like\n# to have a blank new line between each paragraph\n#header-includes:\n#- \\usepackage{tikz}\n---\n",
