David helped spark my interest in the field of quantitative finance while advising me, alongside Professor Parzen, for a statistics research and reading class. Much of the literature I read then served as the foundation for this thesis. David also supervised me directly while I interned at Hutchin Hill Capital during January break, meeting with me daily to discuss progress on my research. I am also very grateful to David for meeting with me throughout the semester to give suggestions and comments on my work. I cannot thank David enough for his time and guidance. Professor Parzen has also been extremely helpful throughout the writing process, offering countless revisions and edit suggestions. I am grateful for Professor Parzen’s statistical perspective, and helping throughout the data collection and analysis portions. I would also like to thank Professor Mark Glickman for looking at my logistic regression model and offering suggestions for improvement, and to my friends and family for proofreading my thesis.   \nbibliography: bib/thesis.bib\n# Download your specific bibliography database file and refer to it in the line above.\ncsl: csl/apa.csl\n# Download your specific csl file and refer to it in the line above.\nlot: true\nlof: true\n# space_between_paragraphs: true\n# Delete the # at the beginning of the previous line if you'd like\n# to have a blank new line between each paragraph\n#header-includes:\n#- \\usepackage{tikz}\n---\n",
