    "contents" : "The low-risk anomaly has created opportunities for arbitrage in the financial markets. As Baker et al. discuss in “Benchmarks as Limits to Arbitrage: Understanding the Low-Volatility Anomaly,” low-volatility and low-beta portfolios outperform and high-volatility and high-beta portfolios by a factor of several times due to benchmarking and lottery-preferences. The iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility (USMV) is an ETF tracking a minimum volatility index that was used to find data and will be used for trading arbitrage. Frazzini et al. discuss arbitrage opportunities by quantitative focused funds like AQR in “Betting Against Beta”, and this thesis explores a more advanced type of index front-running as a potential arbitrage opportunity. Data was collected from USMV from its inception in October 2011, and from EUSA, the parent ETF of USMV, from the same period until December 2016. 52-week trailing beta, 52-week trailing volatility, lagged price/book, and current index membership were calculated, and a regression model was run to quantify the relationship between current index membership and these four variables. In the model, a probabilities of index membership were calculated and an optimal cutoff was calculated to which the model would be 95% accurate of its findings of a stock to be in or out of USMV, given the historical data. Backtesting with prior data showed with a model accuracy of 95%, arbitrage opportunities of X% could be collected after each rebalancing. ",
