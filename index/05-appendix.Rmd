# Conclusions and Further Research
The regression model appeared to be statistically resilient with strong predictive power.

### Beta
The relationship between Beta and current membership in the Minimum Volatility Index was
\hfill\break

### Volatility 
The relationship between Volatility and currentmembership in the Minimum Volatility Index was
\hfill\break

### Price to Book Ratio
The relationship between Price to Book Ratio and current membership in the Minimum Volatility Index was
\hfill\break

### Prior Index Membership
The relationship between Prior Index Membership and current membership in the Minimum Volatility Index was
\hfill\break

## Sector risk
Some sectors were overweight in the Minimum Volatility Index, which would imply they are inherently less risky. 
\hfill\break

## Investment Opportunity  
Based off the accuracy of the top 5 candidates to join and exit the Minimum Volatility Index,

## Future Models and Analysis

\hfill\break
### Model by Sector
Breaking down the data by sector and modeling that way might create a more accurate model 
\hfill\break

### Modeling by Prior Index Membership
Breaking down the data by prior index membership and modeling that way might create a more accurate model 
\hfill\break

### Model by Month
Creating one model for May rebalancing and one model for November rebalancing might create a more accurate model  
\hfill\break

## Limitations 
\hfill\break
### Using ETF data
Using ETF data to forecast index membership is reasonable but not entirely accruate. The iShares data also had many errors that needed to be manually fixed. 
\hfill\break
### Barra Optimizer
The Barra Optimizer is very complex, and this thesis did not take it into account when trying to predict index membership. Had it done so, the model could have been more accruate at predicting index rebalancing.
