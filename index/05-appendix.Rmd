# Conclusions and Future Work
The logistic regression model was statistically resilient and had strong predictive power. Based off of historical data, it was able to correctly predict 86.29% of stocks that were in the minimum volatility index, and 98.19% of the stocks that were not members of the minimum volatility index, using the optimal cut off. Overall, the logistic regression model had a 96.77% accuracy in distinguishing between stocks that were members of the index, and stocks that were not members of the index. The model can also be easily transformed to calculate the probability of a stock being a member of the minimum volatility index based off of its trailing beta, trailing volatility, price to book ratio, and prior index membership. 

## Understanding of Relationships 
The model can help build on previous understanding of what traits of a stock are important in its membership in the minimum volatility index. The relationship between trailing volatility and current membership in the index was unsurprisingly negative; the larger a stock’s volatility, the less likely it is to be in the index. To be specific, the odds of being in the index is 0.96 less with a one unit increase in a stock’s volatility. This makes sense, given the Barra Open Optimizer works to create a minimum variance portfolio. The relationship between beta and membership in the minimum volatility index was also negative; the larger the magnitude of a stock’s beta is, the less likely it is to be in the index. To be specific, a one unit increase in a stock’s beta makes it 0.015 times as likely to be in the index. This makes sense given that beta is a measure of a stock’s volatility as well. However, the regression coefficient for beta was much stronger than the coefficient for volatility, which at first glance appears puzzling, given that this is a minimum volatility index. However, considering the units of each variable can alleviate this concern; a one unit increase in volatility in much less than a one unit increase in beta. For example, it would be extremely very hard for a stock’s beta to jump from 0.7 to 1.7 over a short period of time, and would represent a massive change in a stock, even though it is just one unit. This can help explain this coefficient discrepancy, but it is important to note that both volatility and beta are negatively related to index membership.

The relationship between price to book ratio and current membership in the minimum volatility index was nonexistent in this model. In fact, with a one unit increase in price to book ratio for a stock did not affect a stock’s odds of being a member of the index. This is an interesting finding, in that it might imply a stock’s value is unrelated to its volatility, especially in relation to the importance of profitability in defensive equity strategies [@novy2014]. The relationship between prior index membership and current membership in the minimum volatility index was by far the most powerful. A stock was over 228 times more likely to a member of the index if it was a member six months ago. This is logical, considering a vast majority of the stocks in the index remain. There are approximately 180 stocks in the index, and during each rebalance only around 14 are removed [@blackrock2017]. 

## Sector-Specific Risk
Some sectors were overweight or underweight in the minimum volatility Index, which would imply something about sector-specific risk. Macro-effects, like industry specific effects, have been shown to be important in affecting risk and return of a portfolio [@baker2014]. Based off of the findings in this paper, energy, consumer discretionary, industrials, and materials were shown to be consistently underweight in the minimum volatility index when compared to the parent index. This could mean these sectors are inherently more volatile than other sectors. Moreover, consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities were consistently overweight in the minimum volatility index when compared to the parent index. This could imply that these sectors are inherently less volatile than other sectors.

## Future Models
The logistic regression model took into account all of the data from the months when rebalances took place. However, more specific models could have been made to increase predictive power. Models could have been made by using data by sector. As shown in the analysis, some sectors are more volatile and risky than others, so using stocks without regard to sector might lead to a less accurate model. Sector could also have been used as a categorical predictor variable.

Seeing how significant of a predictor variable previous index membership was in the regression model, it could make sense to create two separate models: one for stocks currently in the minimum volatility index, and one for stocks that are not. This could also help for investment applications, as there will be one model used for short-selling stocks, and one for deciding which stocks to purchase. Finally, creating models by month could be telling too. By combining the May and November rebalancing data, the current model does not take into account specific factors that might be unique to rebalancing that occurs in either period. 

## Investment Implications  
Given the accuracy and predictive power of the logistic regression model, there are many ways it could be applied and used an investment opportunity. If the model can accurately forecast index membership in advance of its rebalancing, investors could long stocks that are predicted to be added to the index, and short the stocks that are expected to be removed from the index. Given that approximately 20 stocks are added and 14 stocks are removed during each rebalancing [@blackrock2017], it could make sense to purchase stock in the top 5 companies that are currently not in the minimum volatility index but have a high probability of being added, and short-sell stocks that are currently in the minimum volatility but have a low probability of remaining. When the iShares MSCI Minimum Volatility ETF is rebalanced, stocks that were added enjoyed an average 0.63% increase in price the day after the announcement, and stocks that were removed lost 0.57% of value after the announcement. Though the values are small by themselves, on an annualized basis, an accurate model could lead to a very lucrative investment strategy.
