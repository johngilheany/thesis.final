The low-risk anomaly is the term in academic literature for the empirical regularity that low-volatility stocks perform as well or better than high-volatility stocks [@baker2011]. The MSCI Minimum Volatility Index is designed to exploit this effect by holding a minimum variance portfolio of stocks. USMV is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the index. I used information from Wharton Research Data Services to calculate the trailing beta, trailing volatility, and price to book ratio for each stock. Using this data, I created a logistic regression model to calculate the probability of an individual stock being a member of the index at the next rebalance. It was found that stocks with lower beta and lower volatility are more likely to be in the index in the next period.
