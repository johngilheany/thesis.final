The low-risk anomaly has created opportunities for long-term focused investors who are not benchmarked against an index. Several studies have shown that low-risk portfolios strongly outperform high-risk portfolios over long periods of time due to this anomaly. Several hedge funds employ trading strategies to bet against factors like beta to take advantage of this occurrence. This thesis explores an investment strategy similar to index front-running through the creation of a logisitc regression model to forecast which stocks will be added or removed from the MSCI Minimum Volatility Index. When a stock is added to the index, there is an average price move of +0.63% the following day, and when a stock is removed from the index, there is an average price move of -0.57% the following day. Data was collected from USMV, the ETF tracking this index, and its parent ETF between October 2011 and December 2016. Data from Wharton Research Data Services was used to calculate trailing beta, trailing volatility, price to book ratio, and previous index membership. A regression model was created using these inputs, which calculated probabilities of index membership for stocks given the historical data. An accurate model that could accurately predict inflow or outflow of stocks could prove to be a profitable trading strategy. The top candidates to enter the index and top candidates to leave the index were determined and compared to actual rebalancing that happened in May 2017.
