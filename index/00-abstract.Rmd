Stocks with low volatility perform as well or better than stocks with high volatility [@van2016]. This effect, termed the low-risk anomaly, has been demonstrated in studies showing that portfolios of low-risk stocks outperform portfolios of high-risk stocks over long periods of time [@baker2011]. The MSCI Minimum Volatility Index is designed to help investors take advantage of this effect. This index uses a software library called the Barra Open Optimizer to create and regularly rebalance a portfolio of low-risk stocks. Investors can trade this portfolio through an ETF (USMV) that tracks the index. Constituent data was collected from USMV between October 2011 and December 2016, and data from Wharton Research Data Services was used to calculate trailing beta, trailing volatility, and price to book ratio for each stock. Using these predictor variables, a logistic regression model was created to calculate the probability of a stock being a member of the index. Though lower beta and lower volatility individually each increased the probability of a stock being in the index, the effect of beta was interestingly stronger. The model was 86% accurate at predicting which stocks would be in the index, and 98% accurate at predicting which stocks would not be in the index. These results suggest there may be an arbitrage opportunity in forecasting future membership in the Minimum Volatility Index.
