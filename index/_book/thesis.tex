\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\section{Background}\label{background}

The iShares Edge MSCI USA Minimum Volatility (USMV) Exchange Traded Fund
(ETF) is designed to track the investment results of the MSCI Minimum
Volatility USA index, which is composed of stocks with a lower
volatility than the general market. This can provide investors with
exposure to a portfolio with less risk compared to many alternatives,
and historically has declined less in value than the broader market
during economic downturns. The ETF is comprised of 189 holdings, and is
rebalanced two times per year, with the intention of mirroring the
changes made by the index. The purpose of this dissertation is to create
a logistic regression model that can accurately predict which stocks
will be added or removed from this ETF before rebalancing occurs, and to
understand what factors are involved. The model will take into account
volatility attributes of each stock, as well as others potentially
significant predictor variables from prior studies. An accurate model
will allow for arbitrage investment opportunities.

\subsection{Exchange Traded Funds
(ETFs)}\label{exchange-traded-funds-etfs}

An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is a collection of stocks and/or bonds in
a single portfolio that is traded on a major exchange just like a stock
is (Hayes, 2017). As a result, the price of an ETF fluctuates on a
regular basis. Exchange Traded Funds generally have more liquidity and
less fees when compared to other alternative instruments, like mutual
funds. Owning an ETF can allow investors to minimize risk, since owning
an ETF is comparable to owning a little bit of many different stocks.
This diversification comes at lower costs and less effort for investors
as well.

ETFs can also track an index, commodity, bond, or basket of all of the
above. Unlike an ETF, which is publicly traded, an index is not. The
goal of the USMV ETF is to track the MSCI Minimum Volatility USA index,
and this is more complicated than it seems. In addition to tracking this
index, the ETF aims to mirror returns of the index, and any difference
between the ETF return and actual index return is called tracking error.
The tracking error is often very small and can be around a tenth of a
percent. This error can come from indices being market capitalization
weighted, meaning that price fluctuations of each stock lead to the
weighting being changed by a ratio of its market cap against the market
cap of all stocks in the index (Fontinelle, 2009). With these stocks
weightings in the index constantly changing and people buying in and out
of ETFs constantly, it is hard to track performance entirely accurately.
However, ETFs very closely follow indices, as their tracking errors are
generally quite small. Thus, although ETF data is not the same as index
data, the two are extremely comparable.

\subsection{iShares MSCI Min Vol USA
ETF}\label{ishares-msci-min-vol-usa-etf}

The iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF (USMV) is a Blackrock-managed ETF
that tracks the investment results of the MSCI Minimum Volatility USA
index. The MSCI Minimum Volatility USA index constituents come from the
MSCI USA Index, which are roughly comprised of the top 600 US stocks by
market cap. This minimum volatility index is intended to have a lower
beta, lower volatility, lower cap bias, and contain more stocks with
less risk than its parent index, which contains US mid-cap and large-cap
stocks. On the last trading days of May and November, the index is
rebalanced twice a year. The index typically has around 180
constituents, with an average of 20 new additions and 14 deletions every
6 months when rebalancing occurs. Over the last five years, the number
of additions has ranged from 12 to 25, while the deletions have been
between 10 and 19. Changes to the index are usually announced nine
trading days before they are set to take place (BlackRock, 2017).

Using the Barra Open Optimizer, USMV creates a minimum variance
portfolio of low-risk stocks as a subset from its parent index of US
large-cap and mid-cap stock. Using this estimated security covariance
matrix, the MSCI Minimum Volatility Index is the product of the lowest
absolute volatility, considering the constraints (MSCI, 2013). Moreover,
these additions are simply a relabeling of existing stocks in the parent
index and do not include new additions to the parent index. The low-risk
stocks chosen to be in USMV are determined by a set of constraints, like
maintaining a certain sector or country weight, relative to the parent
index.

There are many specific constraints to this index. The first is that an
individual stock cannot exceed 1.5\% or 20 times the weight of the stock
in the parent index. The minimum weight of a security in the index is
also capped at 0.05\%. USMV also aims to keep the weight of specific
countries within a 5\% range of the weight in the parent index, or 3
times the weight of the country in the parent index. Sector weights of
USMV cannot deviate more than 5\% from the sector weights in the parent
index. One-way turnover of the index is also maxed at 10\%. Thus, taking
into account these constraints, the Barra Open Optimizer creates the
lowest absolute volatility portfolio possible (Wynne, 2016).

\subsection{Purpose}\label{purpose}

As mentioned, the purpose of this thesis is to create a model to that
will predict rebalancing of stocks in the Min Vol index, and
consequently the USMV ETF, before it actually happens. There is
substantial price movement whenever a stock is added or removed from a
large ETF, like USMV. When a stock is added to the index, the ETF will
buy large amounts of that stock, increasing the demand, and
consequently, the market price for that stock. If the stock is bought in
advance of this large purchase, then the investor can enjoy pretty
immediate price appreciation in the stock. Moreover, if a stock is
removed from the Min Vol index, the USMV ETF will sell all current
holdings of the stock, which will increase the supply of the stock,
driving down market price of the stock. If one were to short this stock
before that happened, he/she can also profit from that event.

A phenomena known as ETF front-running is similar to what this thesis
hopes to accomplish, but is one step behind. ETF front-running occurs
when traders buy or sell stocks in advance of ETF managers after they
announce an exit or entrance of a position (MacDonald, 2009). There is
typically a slight lag between an announcement of an ETF to add or
remove a position and the actual purchase or sale of this position. By
acting quickly, traders can scalp profit by buying a stock before an ETF
does, and selling it to them later at a slight profit, or short-selling
a stock before an ETF exits the position, and then buying it back at the
lower price. This thesis will take things one step farther and try
predict the stock addition or deletion before announcement. This will
allow traders to similarly front-run the index, but they will do so
before the market is able to react, leading to larger profit
opportunities.

\subsection{Logistic Regression Model}\label{logistic-regression-model}

The goals of this paper will be achieved by creating a logistic
regression model, which will be transformed to calculate a probability
of a stock being in the out of the index. A logistic regression model
will be used since the dependent variable is dichotomous. The predictor
variables will include 52-week trailing volatility, 52-week trailing
beta, price/book ratio, and whether or not the stock was in the index 6
months before, during the previous rebalancing. These attributes were
chosen after looking at the historical literature and understanding of
the minimum volatility index.

\section{Literature Review}\label{literature-review}

\subsection{Overview of the Low-Risk
Anomaly}\label{overview-of-the-low-risk-anomaly}

The Low-Risk Anomaly stems from the observation that portfolios of
low-risk stocks have higher risk-adjusted returns than portfolios of
high-risk stocks. This idea challenges a widely regarded financial
principle that investing in higher-risk stocks will generally result in
higher expected return. In several studies, portfolios of high-risk
stocks and low-risk stocks were constructed and rebalanced regularly to
reflect these characteristics, and the low-risk portfolios outperformed
the high-risk portfolios by a factor of several times, over long-periods
of time including 1929-2015 (Vliet \& Koning, 2016) and 1968-2008
(Baker, Bradley, \& Wurgler, 2011).

One of the explanations is the need for money managers to be compared to
a benchmark, such as an index like the S\&P 500. This is reasonable, as
many fund managers are charging fees to manage money, and need a way to
prove themselves and their abilities. By outperforming an index, a fund
manager is able to generate alpha, and presumably raise money money or
change higher fees. By underperforming an index, the fund managers have
a hard time justifying fee charges to clients, since they could just
invest in the index passively for little to no fee. Thus, much of the
risk for them is relative, coming from potentially underperforming on a
benchmark. Moreover, with this doubling of assets under active
management from 30\% to 60\% in 1968-2008, the low-risk anomaly
intensified. Another metric of fund manager performance is through the
``information ratio'' (IR), or the expected return difference between
the manager and the expected return of the S\&P 500, divided by the
volatility of this return difference. The goal of an investment manager
is to maximize this number, best as possible, through picking stocks
that will outperform the market. These help to create a greater demand
for higher-risk stocks while discouraging investments in low-beta,
low-volatility stocks, and ultimately increases the market's appetite
for risky stocks with high reward potential, driving up price and
driving down expected return.

In addition to the focus on relative rather than absolute risk, money
managers also often focus on single period returns, often as short as a
month, which aim to remove the effects of compounding. This helps
differentiate each manager's stock picking abilities, but ignores the
real-world and significance of compounding. Humans also have a
predisposition for the lottery effect, which is increased interest in
stocks with high skew - that is high upside potential. Risk can also be
decomposed into macro and micro-effects - that is, looking for and
comparing the risk-return characteristics of stocks with different risk
profiles, but similar country and industry risks. It turned out that the
micro-effects, those that were stock-specific, were statistically
significant at generating alpha, while the macro-effects, those that
were country and industry-specific was not. These literature reviews
also examine both volatility and beta as a measure of risk and suggest
that beta is not an adequate risk metric. In fact, though beta and
volatility are obviously very correlated, beta appears to be more
related to this low-risk anomaly than volatility. This can have
significant implications on the significance of the predictor variables
in the logistic regression model in this dissertation.

There are many real-world trading strategies that utilize this anomaly.
One example includes betting against Beta (BaB), which is a strategy
used by quantitative hedge funds like AQR. Betting against Correlation
(BaC) is a similar strategy in that it decomposes the effects of beta
into two separate factors for a more concentrated investment. Moreover,
index additions and deletions have proven to be instrumental in
influencing the price of affected stocks, indicating that if a model can
predict these movements accurately beforehand, there is an additional
considerable arbitrage opportunity.

\subsection{Evidence of the Low-Risk
Anomaly}\label{evidence-of-the-low-risk-anomaly}

\subsubsection{Measures of Risk}\label{measures-of-risk}

Assuming an efficient market, one of the most widely accepted tenets of
investing is that one will be receiving higher reward for taking on more
risk. Presumably, if this were not true, nobody would partake in higher
risk investments. Some risks to consider when making an investment
include those with respect to the market, liquidity, credit, inflation,
and FX (Ontario, 2017). When quantifying risk for a company, one can
look at the standard deviation of the stock price. By looking at the
historical dispersion of data from the mean, or normal returns, one
finds the stock's volatility. These calculations are based only on the
price fluctuations of the stock and no other external factors
(Investopedia, 2015). Volatility is also one of the best indicators of
bankruptcy. The other common form of risk measurement in finance is
beta, which measures the stock's price volatility compared to that of
the stock market. The market is typically a benchmarked index relevant
to the stock; for a large-cap US stock, the associated index could be
the S\&P 500. Beta is calculated by taking the covariance of the stock
returns and the market returns, then dividing by the variance of the
market:
\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=1in]{/Users/johngilheany/Desktop/beta.png}}
\caption{Beta}
\label{B}
\end{figure}
This yields a coefficient, which can be interpreted: a beta value of 1
indicates the stock price and market move together identically, a beta
value of less than 1 indicates the stock is less volatile than the
market, and a beta value of greater than 1 indicates the stock is more
volatile than the market. Beta values can be negative as well, and hold
the same interpretation as positive beta values, with the difference
being that the stock price and market move in opposite directions. For
example, a beta of -1 would mean the stock and market have the same
volatility and changes in price, but that the performance is inversely
related. Thus, the first sentence of this paragraph can have many
meanings, but can be interpreted as saying that stocks with higher beta
or volatility will have higher expected return.

\subsubsection{1929-2015}\label{section}

Jan de Koning and Pim Van Vliet set out to investigate the question:
\emph{Do high-volatility stocks return more than low-volatility stocks?}
by constructing high-volatility and low-volatility portfolios, and
comparing the two over a 86-year time span, from 1929-2015. Over this
period, low-volatility stocks outperformed high-volatility stocks by a
factor of 18, excluding inflation and transaction costs. If both
portfolios started off with \$100 in 1929, the low-volatility portfolio
end value would be worth \$395,000, while the high-volatility portfolio
would be worth just \$21,000. In reality, these values would both be
much smaller if the costs of trading the stocks and inflation were
considered, but excluding them is reasonable as the effect on both
portfolios would be pretty similar. The low-volatility portfolio
returned 10.2\% annually whereas the high-volatility portfolio returned
just 6.4\% annually. This annual difference of 3.8\% is striking, and
when considering compounding over an 86-year period, helps explain why
the low-volatility portfolio's value was over 18 times that of the
high-volatility portfolio. In this study, the annualized volatility of
the low-volatility portfolio was 13\%, and the annualized volatility of
the high-volatility portfolio was around 2.5 times that, at 36\% (Vliet
\& Koning, 2016).

\subsubsection{1968-2008}\label{section-1}

Baker et al. performed a study similar to that done by van Vliet and de
Koning, but used 41 years of CRSP data, ranging from January 1968 --
December 2008. It is important to note the ranges of dates used; the
Great Recession began in 2007 after the bursting of the subprime
mortgage bubble, leading to the collapse of several large, investment
banks, and the government bailout of many others. This caused market
indices, like the Dow, to drop from a high in 2007 of 14,164.43 to
8,776.39 by December 2008, representing a decrease in over 38\% during
that period (Amadeo, 2017). Thus, just as van Vliet and De Koning
started their sample right before the Great Depression to help amplify
their results, Baker, Bradley, and Wurgler ended their sample after the
Great Recession. Though this may help amplify the results, this does not
take away from the significance of the findings (Baker et al., 2011).

Baker et al. constructed low-volatility, high-volatility, low-beta, and
high-beta portfolios using the top 1,000 stocks by market capitalization
and then calculated each stock's five-year trailing volatility or beta.
A dollar investment in the low-volatility portfolio in 1968 appreciated
to \$59.55 by 2008, or \$10.12 in real terms, when accounting for
inflation. On the other hand, the highest-volatility portfolio went from
a dollar in value to just 58 cents from 1968-2008, with a real value of
around 10 cents, when considering inflation. Thus the low-volatility
portfolio outperformed the high-volatility portfolio by over 100 times
both in terms of nominal and real value. When using beta as a measure
for risk, the finding was very similar. In the lowest-beta portfolio, a
dollar grew to \$60.46 in nominal value throughout the 41-year period,
or \$10.28 in real value after considering inflation. The highest-beta
portfolio grew from a dollar to \$3.77 in nominal terms, or \$0.64 in
real terms after accounting for the effects of inflation. Thus, the
low-beta portfolio outperformed the high-beta portfolio by a factor of
16, in both nominal and real terms. One interesting observation here is
though both the low-beta and low-volatility portfolios outperformed the
high-beta and high-volatility portfolios, respectively, the discrepancy
was far more pronounced in the case of the the volatility portfolios.
Another significant observation was that investors who owned either the
high-beta or high-volatility portfolio in 1968 would have lost money
when accounting for the effects of inflation by 2008. It is also
important to note that this was just the case for large-cap companies,
as these portfolios were constructed from the top 1,000 stocks in terms
of market capitalization. The fact that this anomaly was observed for
large-cap companies is quite impressive, given there are generally a
lesser degree of mispricing in that realm than with small-cap companies,
because many small-cap stocks are not big enough for institutional
investors to invest in. Thus, this anomaly would be larger if the study
had been done for small-cap stocks instead. In addition, the portfolio
end values assumed no transaction costs, which in reality would have
been considered. The high-beta and high-volatility portfolios also cost
more to rebalance on a monthly level, as was done in the paper, than the
low-beta and low-volatility portfolios, indicating this anomaly is
actually more pronounced than initially reported. Baker et al. noted
that while high-beta portfolios outperformed the low-beta portfolios in
up-markets and underperformed the low-risk portfolios in down-markets,
that the low-beta anomaly persisted in both situations. On a
market-adjusted basis, low-beta consistently generates high alpha (Baker
et al., 2011). This was consistent with prior research (Pettengill,
Sundaram, \& Mathur, 1995).

\subsubsection{Critique of the Capital Asset Pricing
Model}\label{critique-of-the-capital-asset-pricing-model}

These findings are not new or revolutionary and have been observed in
many previous academic articles. Black, Jensen, and Scholes evaluated
some of the assumptions and effectiveness of the Capital Asset Pricing
Model (CAPM) (Jensen, Black, \& Scholes, 1972). CAPM is a model that
quantifies the relationship between risk and expected return for a
stock, and considers that investors should be compensated for the time
value of their money and risk they are taking. This is calculated as the
risk free rate plus the beta times the difference between the risk free
rate and expected market return (Brennan, 1989):
\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{/Users/johngilheany/Desktop/capm.png}}
\caption{Capital Asset Pricing Model}
\label{CAPM}
\end{figure}
This will give the expected return of the stock, and anything in excess
of this will be considered alpha. Black, Jensen, and Scholes were able
to find that expected excess return, alpha, was not strictly
proportional to Beta, as it is mathematically in the CAPM. In 1975,
Haugen and Heins similarly found that there was little support for the
idea that risk premiums have manifested themselves in realized rates of
return. In fact, they pointed out that the relationship between risk and
return is much flatter than it is in the CAPM (Haugen \& Heins, 1975).
Twenty years later, Fama and French famously declared that beta was dead
after finding a flat relationship between beta and stock returns (Fama
\& French, 1992). Many additional papers and researchers have added
evidence for disproving the Capital Asset Pricing Model, and even
suggest that beta may not be the correct measure of risk, meaning that
the relationship between risk and return is not what many people believe
it to be (Mullins, 1982). However, other models relating risk and return
have had difficulty gaining acceptance and widespread usage in the
finance industry.

\subsection{Possible Explanations for the Low-Risk
Anomaly}\label{possible-explanations-for-the-low-risk-anomaly}

\subsubsection{Compounding}\label{compounding}

To fully grasp the low-risk anomaly, it is important to understand that
a higher volatile stock or portfolio will move in greater magnitude than
the underlying market. This holds true for both downside and upside
scenarios. When the market increases in value, a high-volatility stock
will increase in excess of this. For example, if the market increases by
20\% in one year, a high-volatility portfolio would reasonably
appreciate by more than 20\% over the same period. However, when the
market declines, a high-volatility portfolio would be expected to
decrease in excess of this amount. For instance, if the market decreases
by 20\% in one year, a high-volatility portfolio would reasonably
depreciate by more than 20\% over the same period. Lower-volatility
portfolios would react in similar fashion, just with a lesser magnitude
with respect to the market. With this in mind, one way the
low-volatility portfolio is able to outperform the higher-volatility
portfolio is by losing less during times of financial stress. Pim van
Vliet and Jan De Koning conveniently started their analysis right at the
beginning of the most severe economic depression in American history,
the Great Depression (Vliet \& Koning, 2016). The Great Depression began
in 1929 and eroded away around 80\% of the market's value by the time
the recovery began in 1932 (History, 2010). With this in mind, by 1932
the high-volatility portfolio declined by over 80\% while the
low-volatility portfolio declined by less than 80\%. More specifically,
the high-volatility portfolio shrunk from \$100 in value to just \$5
while the low-volatility portfolio shrunk from \$100 in value to \$30.
Thus, the results of this Vliet et al. could be taken with a grain of
salt, since although the portfolios each started off with the same
amount of money in 1929, the low-volatility portfolio was worth 6 times
as much as the high-volatility portfolio just four years later. However,
this is an expected consequence of the high-volatility portfolio, so
these results should not be discredited. With this being said, since the
low-volatility portfolio was able to lose less money during market
downturns, it is able to grow, or compound, its capital more effectively
than the high-volatility portfolio. To illustrate this, the portfolio
values can be considered in 1932, when the high-volatility portfolio
lost over 80\% in value. As Benjamin Graham, a famous value investor,
once noted the mathematical fact that ``once you lose 95\% of your
money, you have to gain 1,900\% just to get back where you started''
(Graham, 1965). Similarly, since the high-volatility portfolio lost six
times as much value as the low-volatility portfolio by 1932, it would
have to outperform the low-volatility portfolio by significantly more
than 600\% in order to return to the same value.

\subsubsection{Benchmarking}\label{benchmarking}

Thus, it seems very counterintuitive that fund managers and investors
would not only invest in low-volatility stocks, as it appears that these
stocks will outperform high-volatility stocks in the long-run. Part of
understanding why this is not a commonplace investment strategy for many
comes from interpreting what risk is defined as by the financial
community. To investors, risk is not necessarily analogous to
volatility, or even losing money. For many fund managers, risk comes
from underperforming a benchmark. David Blitz, the head of quantitative
equity research at Robeco, discussed the need for benchmarking the
performance of investment managers (Vliet \& Koning, 2016). Many
managers, especially of actively managed funds, command handsome
compensation in exchange for their investment acumen and diligence. Many
hedge funds have a ``Two and Twenty'' compensation structure, where the
managers charge a 2\% fee on total assets under management and take an
additional 20\% of profits (Investopedia, 2017). Given the large amount
of fees clients are paying, it is reasonable to believe that they expect
to receive a greater return than if they had invested in a passive,
market tracking ETF. These investment professionals need to prove to
their bosses and clients that they are above average at their job. For
example, if a hedge fund manager returns 10\% in one year, but the
market returns 10\% that same year, the client will be upset, as they
are now receiving a smaller return, given the hefty fees. In this case,
a \$100 investment in a market tracking index would return approximately
\$10 pre-tax, given there are little to no management fees. However,
\$100 invested in a hedge fund with a ``Two and Twenty'' structure would
yield the same initial \$10 pre-tax return, but the client would pay 2\%
of \$100 (\$2) in management fees, and 20\% of the \$10 profits (\$2) in
additional compensation. This would leave the client with a total of \$6
return, or 6\%, after all of the fees are paid out, and around half as
much as if they had invested in a market tracking ETF. As a result,
given the fee structure and client demands, active money managers are
often compared to a market benchmark like the S\&P 500; more
importantly, they are expected to outperform these benchmarks
substantially. Benchmarking also helps add perspective to a manager's
returns. If a manager returns 20\% in one year when the market returns
10\%, he/she will have many happy clients. However, if the manager
returns 20\% in the same year that the market returns 30\%, clients will
not be as pleased. This is a concept known as ``relative'' risk.

Some investors, like individuals saving for retirement, primarily care
about absolute risk, which is the total amount of money that is gained
or lost due to overall stock movements, with regard to the starting
amount of money invested. They will check their portfolio's total
performance without much concern for the exact market return. If their
portfolio gains 20\% in one year, they will be content, even if the
market increases 30\% in the same period. For these investors, the
horizon is long-term, so the short-term performance isn't as important
for them as it is for fund managers who may be trying to raise more
capital or justify high fees from clients. Volatility, in itself,
captures these changes in the price of a stock, and is an absolute risk
measurement. Many institutional investors do not look at risk on an
absolute level, as a retiree or mom-and-pop investor may, but instead
look at the risk of a portfolio with respect to the stock market or some
other widely accepted benchmark. For these investors, the risk is not so
much about losing money, rather it is more centered around lagging the
market or their peers. Investing is very much a relative game. To
further illustrate this idea, in relation to a fund manager, if a
portfolio drops 20\% while the market drops 40\%, this is seen as a much
better outcome than if a portfolio goes up 20\% while the market goes up
40\%. In the former, the manager lost money, but outperformed the market
by 20\%. In the latter, the manager made money but lagged the market by
20\%. This concept can be hard to fully grasp due to the natural bias
towards focus on absolute risk. Many have tried to explain this
seemingly misunderstood phenomena, including Jason Karceski, who noted
that an extrapolation bias could cause mutual fund managers to care more
about outperforming in a bull market, than underperforming in a bear
market (Karceski, 2002).

In fact, in 1968, institutional investors managed 30\% of all money, but
by 2008, the final year of the Baker et al. study, this figure increased
to 60\% (Baker et al., 2011). With this doubling of assets under active
management, the low-risk anomaly intensified. In addition to being
directly benchmarked against an index like the S\&P 500, fund managers
can also be compared using the ``information ratio'' (IR) which is the
expected return difference between the manager and the expected return
of the S\&P 500, divided by the volatility of this return difference
(tracking error) (Goodwin, 1998):
\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2in]{/Users/johngilheany/Desktop/ir.png}}
\caption{Information Ratio}
\label{IR}
\end{figure}
The goal of an investment manager is to maximize this number, as best
possible, through picking stocks. In fact, over 61\% of U.S. mutual fund
managers are benchmarked against the S\&P 500, while over 94\% are
benchmarked to some U.S. index benchmark (Sensoy, 2009). Moreover, SEC
rules require mutual funds to compare their performance to some
benchmark (SEC, 2017). This intuitively makes sense, as it allows
investors to assess the skill and ability of managers in an unbiased
way, and also allows fund managers a chance to differentiate themselves.
However, this makes institutional investors, who are managing the
majority of the money in the United States, less likely to buy
low-volatility stocks, leading to higher prices and lower expected
returns for the high-volatility stocks and further exacerbating the
low-risk anomaly.

Going back to Baker's findings, it is very hard for fund managers to
attain a high IR with a low-risk portfolio. Part of this stems from the
need for investment managers without leverage to find mispriced stocks
with a beta very close to market risk (beta of 1), overweighting
positive-alpha stocks while underweighting negative-alpha stocks. When
comparing the Sharpe ratio of large cap stocks for a low-volatility
portfolio, it was found to be quite high at 0.38. However, the
Information Ratio was a very low 0.08, showing that this would be very
tough for a fund manager to have. To provide a comparison, during
1968-2008, the top value strategy portfolios had an IR of 0.51, and top
momentum strategy portfolios had an IR of 0.64. This is extremely high
compared to the IR of low-volatility stocks in this period, which ranged
from 0.08 to 0.17, showing these constructed low-beta portfolios would
be unlikely to be used by any fund manager. While beta and volatility
are undoubtedly very correlated, this shows that beta is more related to
the anomaly than volatility, especially with large cap stocks, which is
what most fund managers disproportionately focus their investments in
(Baker et al., 2011).

\subsubsection{Single-Period Returns}\label{single-period-returns}

Another explanation of the low-volatility anomaly is an increased focus
on returns over short-term periods by many researchers and investors. By
focusing on ``single period returns,'' which in most academic studies is
just a one-month period, the significance of compounding is removed.
This is more of an arithmetic way to calculate returns, where each
month's return can be averaged, for example. Mathematically, this is not
the correct way to calculate a return since it does remove the effect of
compounding, but is a common way to compare fund managers. Moreover,
when done over very short time periods (like a year), the effect of
compounding is not as significant as it is for very long-term periods.
To illustrate this, the following scenario can be considered: in one
month a portfolio worth \$100 drops 50\% to \$50, then the next month
increases 50\% to \$75. The investment return is dependent on how one
divides the time period. Looking at it on a monthly basis, even though
the portfolio lost \$25 in value, the net return would be -50\% +50\%,
or 0\% (with focus on single period returns, not accounting for
compounding). However, looking at it on a longer-term basis, the net
return was -25\%, as the \$100 portfolio ended up losing \$25 in value.
By not fully including the magic ``return upon return'' effect of
compounding, the high-volatility portfolio discussed earlier performed
more than 6\% better per year (Vliet \& Koning, 2016).

\subsubsection{Psychological and Behavioral
Factors}\label{psychological-and-behavioral-factors}

In addition to the reasons mentioned, there are several psychological
reasons why some investors are not attracted to low-risk stocks. Eric
Falkenstein, a renowned author in the low-volatility investing realm,
wrote that ``envy is at the root of the investment paradox''
(Falkenstein, 2012). Some investors simply don't recognize the
significance of compounding returns. Many others do but are unable to
utilize the paradox due to relative risk and career pressures. Analysts
who choose big winners are more likely to get recognized and promoted
than those who pick safer stocks with lower upside potential; funds that
pick the right high-risk stocks that turn out to be major home-runs will
see more reward as an increase in AUM, and consequently an uptick in
management fees. Moreover, some people do not invest in low-risk stocks
because they have less of an appeal than high-risk stocks, where
investors think they can make a lot of money easily and quickly. Even
the news will have a bias towards reporting about and covering stocks
that have become big winners. One famous big winner is Amazon: a \$5,000
investment in 1997 would be worth \$2,400,000 today, or an increase
49,000\% (Berger, 2017). With all the excitement and reporting to this
day on big winners like Amazon, many people forget about the number of
similar technology companies that failed during the dot-com bubble and
are worth nothing today. Thus, these high-risk stocks are more ``sexy''
and have a ``lottery ticket'' element that tempts investors with the
appeal of a big payday.

Many investors have a natural preference for lotteries, even though
there is a general aversion towards loss. If a stock has a positive
skew, which is defined as a larger probability of a large positive
payoff than probability of a small payoff, investors typically are very
interested (Baker et al., 2011). Though skew is not the same as
volatility, through their research, Boyer, Mitton, and Vorkink made a
strong case for how expected skewness is a proxy for volatility through
their findings that expected skewness assisted in explaining the
observation that stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility have low
expected returns (Boyer, Mitton, \& Vorkink, 2009).

Another idea is representativeness, or that Bayes' rule and probability
theory are often not natural to people, even in the most seasoned
investment professionals. One example of this is selectively looking at
a few speculative investments that have turned out to be massive
successes without considering the numerous failures. As mentioned
earlier, the news will focus on Amazon's great success over the past
twenty years, but will not focus as much on all of the tech stocks that
became worthless after the bubble burst. By not separating and
considering all winners and losers, the average investor may be inclined
to overpay for a riskier stock (Baker et al., 2011).

Overconfidence has also been tied to a preference for volatile stocks;
optimists are generally more aggressive than pessimists. In a study,
people were asked questions on how certain they were of their responses
and it appeared many did not have an understanding of probability.
Estimating the heat of a candle flame is very difficult, so for someone
to say they are 80\% sure of their answer is impressive, yet hard to
believe. This can apply when people are asked for a confidence interval
of the population of a city. In many instances, the person would be
confident and give a very narrow range of people (Fischhoff, Slovic, \&
Lichtenstein, 1977). This same concept applies when valuing stocks and
evaluating certain investment opportunities.

Overall, irrational investor preference for lotteries and
high-volatility stocks, as well as investment managers' focus on
benchmarks and IR, flatten and eventually invert the relationship
between risk and return in the long-run. Moreover, it has been shown by
Baker et al., and prior observations that the anomaly intensified with
the increase in assets under active management of fund managers in the
U.S. These reasons together have led to the findings that low-beta and
low-volatility stocks have outperformed high-beta, high-volatility
stocks from 1968-2008, in part due to combining great returns with low
downturns. Investor preference for ``lotteries'' and a bias of
overconfidence creates a higher demand for higher-volatility securities,
and the need to benchmark creates a greater demand for higher risk
stocks, while discouraging investments in low-beta, low-volatility
stocks. This understandably, increases the market's appetite for risky
stocks with high reward potential, driving up price and driving down
expected return. These reasons appear perennial, so the anomaly is
unlikely to cease to exist in the near future.

\subsubsection{Profitability and Value}\label{profitability-and-value}

Defensive equity strategies generally aim at constructing a portfolio
comprised of more low-risk stocks. This strategy has been becoming very
popular as of late, in part due to equity markets that have suffered two
recent, severe downturns, negative nominal returns in the first decade
of 2000, and literature proving a weak or negative relationship between
risk and return (Novy-Marx, 2014). Prior literature has looked at the
relationship of performance relative to size and value, but many studies
have not done a deeper dive into the effect of specific factors, such as
profitability (Chan, Hamao, \& Lakonishok, 1991). In fact, it has been
shown that high profitability is the most significant predictor of
low-volatility, inherently causing these defensive equity strategies to
indirectly tilt towards profitability, in addition to the more known
factors, like size and value. Size is very important, as small growth
stocks are typically underweight in these strategies, while large value
stocks are overweight. Likewise, value stocks are typically overweight,
while growth stocks are underweight. Thus, the performance of defensive
equity strategies can be explained by accounting for size, value, and
profitability (Novy-Marx, 2014).

In terms of performance, defensive equity strategies, which are defined
as low-volatility or low-beta in nature, have outperformed more
aggressive strategies. This was already shown between 1929-2008 (Vliet
\& Koning, 2016) and in a separate study from 1968-2015 (Baker et al.,
2011), but Novy-Marx analyzes a different timeframe. He looks at the
characteristics of these low-risk portfolios in more detail by analyzing
log-likelihood ratios that a stock selected at random is of a given
style, like size or value, relative to the unconditional probability of
being that style (Novy-Marx, 2014). The findings were very telling: on
average, low-volatility stocks were 30 times larger than high-volatility
stocks. As a result, though the high-volatility names made up half the
total number of stocks, they contributed to just 9\% of the total market
capitalization when compared with low-volatility stocks. Moreover, when
looking at the average returns across the portfolios of various
volatilities, there seemed to be a relatively flat, slightly increased
return with increasing volatility. The high-volatility/high-beta
portfolio had a significant negative alpha, while the
low-volatility/low-beta portfolio had a significant positive alpha
(Novy-Marx, 2014).

Many of the volatile stocks tended to be small, unprofitable growth
stocks which can help explain the relationship of the defensive strategy
performance to size, value, and profitability. In fact, since 1968-2015,
the portfolio of high-volatility stocks almost mirrored the performance
of the portfolio of unprofitable, small growth stocks. Thus, the
outperformance of defensive stocks from 1968-2015 have delivered
significant alpha and can be explained when accounting for size, value,
and profitability. In fact, profitability itself is so significant, that
the case can be made that this alpha may come in large part from
excluding unprofitable, small growth stocks (Novy-Marx, 2014).

\subsection{Further Decomposition of the Low-Risk Anomaly into Micro and
Macro
Effects}\label{further-decomposition-of-the-low-risk-anomaly-into-micro-and-macro-effects}

The low-beta anomaly can be further broken up into micro and macro
effects. The micro effects can be observed through picking low-beta
stocks, and keeping country and industry risk the same, while the macro
effects can be isolated by picking low-beta countries or industries,
while keeping stock-specific risk the same. Baker et al. generates
observable micro effects by creating portfolios of equity longs and
shorts, holding forecasted country and industry risk constant. The macro
effects were observed by constructing long-short portfolios of various
countries and industries, holding forecasted stock-specific risk
constant. Studying a number of stocks within 29 industries and 31
different developed countries, the macro and micro effects were observed
and, both together, were shown to play an important role in explaining
the low-risk anomaly (Baker, Bradley, \& Taliaferro, 2014).

Looking at 31 developed countries including Canada, France, Germany,
Japan, and Singapore, Baker et al. worked to decompose the low-risk
anomaly into country and stock specific effects. Similar to the industry
findings, country-beta was able to predict stock betas to a certain
extent, but not as well as historical stock betas were. Looking only at
country betas yielded around half the risk reduction and two-thirds the
risk-adjusted return improvement, as compared to stock betas. This study
implied that predicting risk of individual stocks is in itself very hard
when only given data on country or industry risk, but when given all the
data can have much more predictive power (Baker et al., 2014).

It was found that using industry beta to predict future stock betas was
possible, but not as effective as just using historical stock betas.
Industry beta information without stock information does improve
risk-adjusted returns, just not to the same extent as stock information
does. Baker et al. go into detail trying to isolate pure-industry
effects and pure-stock effects. Pure-industry effects are the average
differences between high and low-beta industries, while holding constant
stock risk. Pure-stock risk is the opposite of that, calculating the
average difference between high-beta and low-beta stocks, keeping
industry risk constant. In the end, finding low-risk portfolios using
selection of low-risk stocks and keeping industry constant was around
four times more effective than using low-risk industries and keeping
stock risk constant. However, once again, using the historical betas of
both together, has more predictive power than either one alone (Baker et
al., 2014).

Micro-selection of stocks, holding country and industry risks constant,
was shown to significantly reduce risk without a significant decrease in
return. In some cases, high-risk stocks within particular industries
were able to be distinctly identified, and they typically had similar
returns when compared to low-risk stocks in the same industry and
country. Macro-selection, which involved holding stock-specific risks
constant, was shown to lead to increases in return with small
differences in risk, especially with regards to the country chosen.
Stocks in high-risk countries were found to have distinctly lower
returns than low-risk countries. These findings hold significant
investment opportunity, due to the implication that people seeking
arbitrage opportunities through mispricing of macro-effects like
industry and sector, or through ETFs might not be as successful as
exploiting the risk reduction opportunities stemming from micro-effects.
While both the micro and macro-effects led to higher CAPM alpha by
reducing risk and increasing returns, only the micro-effects were found
to be statistically significant, whereas the macro-effects of country
selection and industry selection were not found to be statistically
significant. Thus, there is more of an arbitrage opportunity exploiting
the micro-effects of individual stock selection than the macro-effects
like country to industry. Even though the macro-effects have many
limitations in practice, micro-effects are also limited due to leverage
restrictions and benchmark mandates.

\subsection{Real-World Applications of the Low-Risk
Anomaly}\label{real-world-applications-of-the-low-risk-anomaly}

\subsubsection{Betting Against Beta
(BaB)}\label{betting-against-beta-bab}

Prior studies suggest that beta is not a great measure of risk and is
more related to the anomaly than volatility is. AQR, a successful
quantitative-focused hedge fund, employs a strategy called Betting
Against Beta (BaB), which is a simple method of statistical arbitrage
generated by shorting high-beta stocks and longing low-beta stocks
(Investopedia, 2015). As discussed in some of the works previously, the
premise behind this arbitrage opportunity is that high-beta stocks are
overpriced while low-beta stocks are underpriced. The theory is that the
stocks will eventually return to this equilibrium point, called the
security market line (SML). While the prices approach this median, the
investor can capture this spread as an arbitrage opportunity
(Investopedia, 2015).

The Capital Asset Pricing Model calculates the expected equity return
given certain levels of risk. Any excess above this risk-adjusted return
is the Sharpe Ratio, or alpha that is generated by the stock. The Sharpe
Ratio is calculated by taking the mean portfolio return and subtracting
the risk free rate, then dividing by the standard deviation of portfolio
returns (Investopedia, 2017):
\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{/Users/johngilheany/Desktop/sharpe.png}}
\caption{Sharpe Ratio}
\label{Sharpe}
\end{figure}
Investors try to maximize this number, and one way to do it is by
levering up, or using borrowed capital to invest. By paying a fixed
interest rate on the borrowed capital, assuming the return is more than
the interest rate, an investor can increase the return on their invested
equity. As one may imagine, this is more risky, as returns in both the
upward and downward direction are magnified. As a result, many
investment managers, like mutual funds, are legally constrained on the
amount of leverage they can apply to a portfolio. Due to this, many fund
managers must overweight high-beta stocks to improve overall returns.
This leads to a tilting towards beta, and a flattening of this SML in
relation to CAPM. This leads to a pricing anomaly which firms like AQR
can take advantage of. By creating a market neutral strategy, and
shorting high-beta stocks while longing low-beta stocks, they can
capture this opportunity.

Andrea Frazzini and Lasse Heje Pedersen of AQR describe this strategy
through a model in one of their studies (Frazzini \& Pedersen, 2014). In
this paper, a real-world resembling model is created with leverage and
margin constraints in 55,600 stocks from 20 global stock, bond, credit,
and future markets. Some agents in this model cannot use any leverage,
and some have limited margin constraints, much like many investors and
fund managers. As mentioned, many mutual funds, pension funds, and
individual investors are constrained by the amount of leverage they can
take on, such that instead of investing in a portfolio yielding the
highest Sharpe Ratio, they are forced to overweight portfolios with
riskier stocks. This suggests fund managers hold high-beta stocks to a
lower risk adjusted return standard than low-beta stocks, which would
require leverage. Thus, if someone cannot leverage or has significant
leverage constraints, then they will overweight riskier securities. The
model in this paper was able to empirically show this in the equities,
bonds, and futures markets. This was done by sorting portfolios by
betas, and realizing alphas and Sharpe Ratios declined with increases in
portfolio-beta (Frazzini \& Pedersen, 2014).

Presumably, if one could lever up without constraint, the investor would
underweight high-beta assets and overweight low-beta assets. BaB factors
help explain this. A BaB factor is a portfolio longing low-beta
securities (leveraged to a beta of 1), shorting high-beta assets
(deleveraged to a beta of 1), that is market neutral. Frazzini's model
predicts that this portfolio will have a positive return that increases
with the spread in the betas and tightness of leverage constraints.
Thus, being long low-beta stocks and short high-beta stocks yields
significant, and positive risk-adjusted returns. This was observed in
the model by looking at U.S., developing, and international equity
markets and noting that the BaB factor yielded a Sharpe ratio that was
double its value effect, and 40\% greater than momentum. The BaB factor
had very high risk-adjusted returns, and during four twenty-year periods
between 1926 and 2012, produced significant positive returns. This
generally held across other asset classes, too, including credit and
treasury bond markets (Frazzini \& Pedersen, 2014).

When a leverage constraint was met or surpassed, and the agent needs to
deleverage, the BaB factor portfolio experiences negative returns, but
its expected future returns still increased. This was once again shown
with a time series with spreads of various funding constraints. Another
central idea of the model was that increased funding liquidity risk
compresses betas toward one. Frazzini et al. proved this by looking at
the volatility of funding constraints as funding liquidity risk; the end
finding was that the dispersion of betas when funding liquidity risk is
high, and was much lower than when funding liquidity risk is low. In
other words, tightening of funding constraints leads to a lower BaB
factor (Frazzini \& Pedersen, 2014).

Finally, the model showed that investors who are more
leverage-constrained are forced to overweight riskier securities, while
investors without such constraints could overweight low-risk securities.
Observing a number of stock portfolios from constrained investors showed
most fund managers and individual investors' portfolios have a beta
greater than one. However, many private equity firms that perform
leveraged buyouts are traditionally able to purchase firms with a beta
below one and apply leverage, allowing them to utilize this anomaly due
to the the fact that they have lower leverage constraints than their
public market counterparts. Famed investor Warren Buffett even bets
against beta, as many of his investments are leveraged, low-beta stocks.
By having these constraints, though, the typical public markets investor
is forced to hold on to riskier, high-beta stocks, leading to
effectiveness of the BaB factor (Frazzini \& Pedersen, 2014).

\subsubsection{Betting Against
Correlation}\label{betting-against-correlation}

In trying to understand the low-risk anomaly and how it could be
applied, Asness et al. considered two possible explanations. The first
looked at whether it was caused by leverage constraints, or measurement
using systematic risk. The second focused on the behavioral effects, or
idiosyncratic risks. One of the main issues with prior research is that
many low-risk factors are correlated and interrelated, making it hard to
completely isolate certain factors or effects. Adrian et al. showed a
link between return of the BaB factor and financial intermediary
leverage (Adrian, Etula, \& Muir, 2014). Many of these factors,
including BaB, generally exhibited the ``low-risk effect'' and were
consequently very difficult to completely distinguish from one another.

Asness et al. attempted to clarify this by introducing a couple new
factors meant to control for existing factors (Asness, Frazzini,
Gormsen, \& Pedersen, 2016). They broke down BaB into two separate
factors: betting against correlation (BaC) and betting against
volatility (BAV). This was done because beta itself is calculated by
taking the stock's correlation with the market times its own volatility
and dividing by the market's overall volatility. BaC is accomplished
through longing stocks with a low correlation to the market, and
shorting those with a high correlation to the market, while trying to
match the volatilities of both the long and short portfolios. BAV is
achieved in a similar manner, except through longing stocks with
low-volatility and shorting high-volatility stocks while keeping
correlation constant.

To address the behavioral explanation, Asness et al. looked at some
prior factors from observations made by Ang et al. (Ang, Hodrick, Xing,
\& Zhang, 2006). They found that stocks with low idiosyncratic
volatility (IVOL) had a greater risk-adjusted return, and in 2009 added
to this by finding that a low maximum return (LMAX), a measure of
idiosyncratic skewness, is associated with greater risk-adjusted returns
(Ang, Hodrick, Xing, \& Zhang, 2009). Asness et al. kept the focus on
the LMAX and IVOL, but added another factor, scaled MAX (SMAX), which
longs stocks with a low MAX return divided by ex-ante volatility, and
consequently shorts stocks with a high MAX return divided by ex-ante
volatility (Asness et al., 2016). This allows focus on the lottery
demand, holding volatility relatively constant and only focusing on the
distribution of the returns. Margin debt held by investors and investor
sentiment were also noted.

Overall, 58,415 stocks from the MSCI World Index from 24 different
countries between January 1926 and December 2015 were covered (Asness et
al., 2016). BAV and BaC were found to be very successful in controlling
for the other factors that could influence the ``low-risk effect.'' The
BAV findings are in line with prior findings, and can be explained
through behavioral effects like the lottery preference and leverage
aversion. For all stocks, the BaC factor produced a significant
six-factor alpha that was nearly independent of the other low-risk
factors studied. This was partially due to the leverage aversion, which
indicates correlation changes in beta should be priced in. In terms of
explaining the behavioral side with factors, SMAX was the only truly
great, resilient measure used. The rest generally had higher turnover,
and were consequently very susceptible to microstructure noise. SMAX
attained positive risk-adjusted returns in the U.S. but negative
risk-adjusted returns globally, which was seen with some other
idiosyncratic risk factors. Asness et al. showed that systemic low-risk
factors generally tended to outperform behavioral risk factors,
especially when considering turnover and time period length. All in all,
the low-risk effect was believed to be driven by multiple factor
effects, meaning both leverage constraints and lottery demand could play
a role in influencing this. However, leverage constraint effects were a
bit stronger, especially internationally. By cleaning up these factors,
clearer explanations for previously observed results were provided
(Asness et al., 2016).

\subsubsection{Stock Price Response to Index
Rebalancing}\label{stock-price-response-to-index-rebalancing}

One of the driving fundamental assumptions of finance is a flat demand
curve for stocks, where risk is the main driver and each stock has a
perfect substitute. However, this concept has been questioned for the
past few years, with literature picking up on stocks showing supply
shocks and quantifying how this affects their market price. Literature
has shown several instances where large block sales of stock has
negatively affected its price (Harris \& Gurel, 1986). This was often
due to information contamination, which is new, significant information
about the company in the market. This information often reflects
fundamental changes in the company, and, if it is negative, will
understandably trigger block sales. Thus, the price change could be less
due to the supply shock, and caused more by fundamental changes in the
company's value, such as a scandal or earnings report release.

However, interesting patterns that have not yet been fully explained
emerge from observations regarding S\&P 500 company addition and
deletions. When companies are added or removed from the index, it is
often purely mechanical and usually not due to some drastic fundamental
change in the company. Assuming the market is efficient, the demand for
stocks should not change due to being added or removed from an index,
but several studies have shown that it does (Shleifer, 1986). The
studies agree that new additions to the S\&P come with higher than
normal returns for that company (Beneish \& Whaley, 1996). Though they
agree on the price movement, the studies tend to disagree on the precise
reason for this price movement; some possible explanations include:
compensation for providing liquidity, better monitoring for investors
when a company is added to a reputable and large index, and higher
analyst coverage leading to more information and analysis available on
the company (Chen, Noronha, \& Singal, 2004). One primary concern is
whether or not index reshuffling is an information-free event - that is,
whether a company being added or removed adds information about the
company to the market.

Huji et al. looked at factor index rebalancing for an information-free
event (Huij \& Kyosev, 2016). Factor indices are part of a parent index
of many other stocks and are constructed in a mechanical way that is
publicly available and usually based on ranking stocks off a particular
ratio of characteristic. The authors looked at one example, the MSCI
Minimum Volatility index, and recorded returns for the stocks that had
been added or dropped. It was found that the cumulative return from
announcement to the effective day was 1.07\% for stocks added with a
significant t-statistic of 7.16, with 62\% of the stocks exhibiting a
positive cumulative abnormal return. Of the 1.07\% increase, 0.63\% of
it was gained the following day, indicating that a large part of the
increase was due to greater demand from index funds. 0.31\% of the
return was lost five days after the rebalancing, but generally the price
tended to stabilize after around ten days. Thus, 68\% of the price
increase was long lasting while the other 32\% was temporary and lost
after a few days. This can be due to a liquidity premium charged by the
stock's owner or arbitrage activity. Average trading volume was also
significantly higher for stocks that were recently added to the index.
For the days between the announcement and actual addition of the stock,
the average trading volume was 30\% higher than normal, with a
significant t-statistic of 3.81. Moreover, there was a 74\% increase in
volume for the day prior to the actual addition of the security. A very
similar phenomena occurs with stocks set to be dropped from the USMV
Index; from the announcement of a stock being dropped to the day before
it is actually deleted from the index, the total cumulative abnormal
return was -0.91\%, and a total of -0.57\% came the day before. After
the stocks were deleted, 64\% had a negative return the following day,
and only 0.49\% of the -0.91\% was regained after three weeks. Trading
volume also spiked 46\% on the day prior to removal from the index.
After three weeks, it returned back to within 1\% of the normal trading
volume (Huij \& Kyosev, 2016).

These findings imply that once a security is added to a factor index,
the demand curve shifts to the right, moving the equilibrium. The
trading volume change is likely due to index funds buying or selling
massive amounts of the stocks that will be added or removed. Moreover,
it was found that the amount of the return is also directly related to
the weighting of the volume of stocks entering or leaving the factor
index. All in all, these findings suggest an index arbitrage opportunity
exists if index additions or deletions can be accurately predicted.

\chapter{Mathematics and Science}\label{math-sci}

\section{Math}\label{math}

\TeX~is the best way to typeset mathematics. Donald Knuth designed
\TeX~when he got frustrated at how long it was taking the typesetters to
finish his book, which contained a lot of mathematics. One nice feature
of \emph{R Markdown} is its ability to read LaTeX code directly.

If you are doing a thesis that will involve lots of math, you will want
to read the following section which has been commented out. If you're
not going to use math, skip over or delete this next commented section.

\section{Chemistry 101: Symbols}\label{chemistry-101-symbols}

Chemical formulas will look best if they are not italicized. Get around
math mode's automatic italicizing in LaTeX by using the argument
\texttt{\$\textbackslash{}mathrm\{formula\ here\}\$}, with your formula
inside the curly brackets. (Notice the use of the backticks here which
enclose text that acts as code.)

So, \(\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}Cr_2O_4}\) is written
\texttt{\$\textbackslash{}mathrm\{Fe\_2\^{}\{2+\}Cr\_2O\_4\}\$}.

\noindent Exponent or Superscript: \(\mathrm{O^-}\)

\noindent Subscript: \(\mathrm{CH_4}\)

To stack numbers or letters as in \(\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}}\), the subscript
is defined first, and then the superscript is defined.

\noindent Bullet: CuCl \(\bullet\) \(\mathrm{7H_{2}O}\)

\noindent Delta: \(\Delta\)

\noindent Reaction Arrows: \(\longrightarrow\) or
\(\xrightarrow{solution}\)

\noindent Resonance Arrows: \(\leftrightarrow\)

\noindent Reversible Reaction Arrows: \(\rightleftharpoons\)

\subsection{Typesetting reactions}\label{typesetting-reactions}

You may wish to put your reaction in an equation environment, which
means that LaTeX will place the reaction where it fits and will number
the equations for you.
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{C_6H_{12}O_6  + 6O_2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{6CO_2 + 6H_2O}
  \label{eq:reaction}
\end{equation}
We can reference this combustion of glucose reaction via Equation
\eqref{eq:reaction}.

\subsection{Other examples of
reactions}\label{other-examples-of-reactions}

\(\mathrm{NH_4Cl_{(s)}}\) \(\rightleftharpoons\)
\(\mathrm{NH_{3(g)}+HCl_{(g)}}\)

\noindent \(\mathrm{MeCH_2Br + Mg}\) \(\xrightarrow[below]{above}\)
\(\mathrm{MeCH_2\bullet Mg \bullet Br}\)

\section{Physics}\label{physics}

Many of the symbols you will need can be found on the math page
\url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/math.html} and the Comprehensive
LaTeX Symbol Guide
(\url{http://mirror.utexas.edu/ctan/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-letter.pdf}).

\section{Biology}\label{biology}

You will probably find the resources at
\url{http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/latex.html} helpful, particularly
the links to bsts for various journals. You may also be interested in
TeXShade for nucleotide typesetting
(\url{http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/beitz/txe.html}). Be sure to
read the proceeding chapter on graphics and tables.

\chapter{Tables, Graphics, References, and Labels}\label{ref-labels}

\section{Tables}\label{tables}

In addition to the tables that can be automatically generated from a
data frame in \textbf{R} that you saw in {[}R Markdown Basics{]} using
the \texttt{kable} function, you can also create tables using
\emph{pandoc}. (More information is available at
\url{http://pandoc.org/README.html\#tables}.) This might be useful if
you don't have values specifically stored in \textbf{R}, but you'd like
to display them in table form. Below is an example. Pay careful
attention to the alignment in the table and hyphens to create the rows
and columns.
\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccc@{}}
\caption{\label{tab:inher} Correlation of Inheritance Factors for Parents

\bottomrule
\end{longtable}
We can also create a link to the table by doing the following: Table
\ref{tab:inher}. If you go back to {[}Loading and exploring data{]} and
look at the \texttt{kable} table, we can create a reference to this max
delays table too: Table \ref{tab:maxdelays}. The addition of the
\texttt{(\textbackslash{}\#tab:inher)} option to the end of the table
caption allows us to then make a reference to Table
\texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(tab:label)}. Note that this reference could
appear anywhere throughout the document after the table has appeared.

\section{Figures}\label{figures}

If your thesis has a lot of figures, \emph{R Markdown} might behave
better for you than that other word processor. One perk is that it will
automatically number the figures accordingly in each chapter. You'll
also be able to create a label for each figure, add a caption, and then
reference the figure in a way similar to what we saw with tables
earlier. If you label your figures, you can move the figures around and
\emph{R Markdown} will automatically adjust the numbering for you. No
need for you to remember! So that you don't have to get too far into
LaTeX to do this, a couple \textbf{R} functions have been created for
you to assist. You'll see their use below.

In the \textbf{R} chunk below, we will load in a picture stored as
\texttt{reed.jpg} in our main directory. We then give it the caption of
``Reed logo'', the label of ``reedlogo'', and specify that this is a
figure. Make note of the different \textbf{R} chunk options that are
given in the R Markdown file (not shown in the knitted document).
\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{include_graphics}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{path =} \StringTok{"figure/reed.jpg"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{figure/reed.jpg}
\caption{\label{fig:reedlogo}Reed logo}
\end{figure}
Here is a reference to the Reed logo: Figure \ref{fig:reedlogo}. Note
the use of the \texttt{fig:} code here. By naming the \textbf{R} chunk
that contains the figure, we can then reference that figure later as
done in the first sentence here. We can also specify the caption for the
figure via the R chunk option \texttt{fig.cap}.

\clearpage 

Below we will investigate how to save the output of an \textbf{R} plot
and label it in a way similar to that done above. Recall the
\texttt{flights} dataset from Chapter \ref{rmd-basics}. (Note that we've
shown a different way to reference a section or chapter here.) We will
next explore a bar graph with the mean flight departure delays by
airline from Portland for 2014. Note also the use of the \texttt{scale}
parameter which is discussed on the next page.
\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{flights %>%}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(carrier) %>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{mean_dep_delay =} \KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(dep_delay)) %>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =} \NormalTok{carrier, }\DataTypeTok{y =} \NormalTok{mean_dep_delay)) +}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_bar}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{position =} \StringTok{"identity"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{stat =} \StringTok{"identity"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{fill =} \StringTok{"red"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{thesis_files/figure-latex/delaysboxplot-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:delaysboxplot}Mean Delays by Airline}
\end{figure}
Here is a reference to this image: Figure \ref{fig:delaysboxplot}.

A table linking these carrier codes to airline names is available at
\url{https://github.com/ismayc/pnwflights14/blob/master/data/airlines.csv}.

\clearpage

Next, we will explore the use of the \texttt{out.extra} chunk option,
which can be used to shrink or expand an image loaded from a file by
specifying \texttt{"scale=\ "}. Here we use the mathematical graph
stored in the ``subdivision.pdf'' file.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{figure/subdivision} \caption{Subdiv. graph}\label{fig:subd}
\end{figure}
Here is a reference to this image: Figure \ref{fig:subd}. Note that
\texttt{echo=FALSE} is specified so that the \textbf{R} code is hidden
in the document.

\textbf{More Figure Stuff}

Lastly, we will explore how to rotate and enlarge figures using the
\texttt{out.extra} chunk option. (Currently this only works in the PDF
version of the book.)
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[angle=180, scale=1.1]{figure/subdivision} \caption{A Larger Figure, Flipped Upside Down}\label{fig:subd2}
\end{figure}
As another example, here is a reference: Figure \ref{fig:subd2}.

\section{Footnotes and Endnotes}\label{footnotes-and-endnotes}

You might want to footnote something.\footnote{footnote text} The
footnote will be in a smaller font and placed appropriately. Endnotes
work in much the same way. More information can be found about both on
the CUS site or feel free to reach out to
\href{mailto:data@reed.edu}{\nolinkurl{data@reed.edu}}.

\section{Bibliographies}\label{bibliographies}

Of course you will need to cite things, and you will probably accumulate
an armful of sources. There are a variety of tools available for
creating a bibliography database (stored with the .bib extension). In
addition to BibTeX suggested below, you may want to consider using the
free and easy-to-use tool called Zotero. The Reed librarians have
created Zotero documentation at
\url{http://libguides.reed.edu/citation/zotero}. In addition, a tutorial
is available from Middlebury College at
\url{http://sites.middlebury.edu/zoteromiddlebury/}.

\emph{R Markdown} uses \emph{pandoc} (\url{http://pandoc.org/}) to build
its bibliographies. One nice caveat of this is that you won't have to do
a second compile to load in references as standard LaTeX requires. To
cite references in your thesis (after creating your bibliography
database), place the reference name inside square brackets and precede
it by the ``at'' symbol. For example, here's a reference to a book about
worrying: (Molina \& Borkovec, 1994). This \texttt{Molina1994} entry
appears in a file called \texttt{thesis.bib} in the \texttt{bib} folder.
This bibliography database file was created by a program called BibTeX.
You can call this file something else if you like (look at the YAML
header in the main .Rmd file) and, by default, is to placed in the
\texttt{bib} folder.

For more information about BibTeX and bibliographies, see our CUS site
(\url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/index.html})\footnote{Reed~College
  (2007)}. There are three pages on this topic: \emph{bibtex} (which
talks about using BibTeX, at
\url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtex.html}),
\emph{bibtexstyles} (about how to find and use the bibliography style
that best suits your needs, at
\url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtexstyles.html}) and
\emph{bibman} (which covers how to make and maintain a bibliography by
hand, without BibTeX, at
\url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibman.html}). The last page
will not be useful unless you have only a few sources.

If you look at the YAML header at the top of the main .Rmd file you can
see that we can specify the style of the bibliography by referencing the
appropriate csl file. You can download a variety of different style
files at \url{https://www.zotero.org/styles}. Make sure to download the
file into the csl folder.

\textbf{Tips for Bibliographies}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Like with thesis formatting, the sooner you start compiling your
  bibliography for something as large as thesis, the better. Typing in
  source after source is mind-numbing enough; do you really want to do
  it for hours on end in late April? Think of it as procrastination.
\item
  The cite key (a citation's label) needs to be unique from the other
  entries.
\item
  When you have more than one author or editor, you need to separate
  each author's name by the word ``and'' e.g.
  \texttt{Author\ =\ \{Noble,\ Sam\ and\ Youngberg,\ Jessica\},}.
\item
  Bibliographies made using BibTeX (whether manually or using a manager)
  accept LaTeX markup, so you can italicize and add symbols as
  necessary.
\item
  To force capitalization in an article title or where all lowercase is
  generally used, bracket the capital letter in curly braces.
\item
  You can add a Reed Thesis citation\footnote{Noble (2002)} option. The
  best way to do this is to use the phdthesis type of citation, and use
  the optional ``type'' field to enter ``Reed thesis'' or
  ``Undergraduate thesis.''
\end{itemize}
\section{Anything else?}\label{anything-else}

If you'd like to see examples of other things in this template, please
contact the Data @ Reed team (email
\href{mailto:data@reed.edu}{\nolinkurl{data@reed.edu}}) with your
suggestions. We love to see people using \emph{R Markdown} for their
theses, and are happy to help.

\chapter*{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Conclusion}

If we don't want Conclusion to have a chapter number next to it, we can
add the \texttt{\{-\}} attribute.

\textbf{More info}

And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter
title or section head \emph{shouldn't be} indented, because indents are
to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph. Since that's
obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add
an indent there.
